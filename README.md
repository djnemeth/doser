# DoSer

DoSer is intended to be a proof-of-concept implementation of an image
segmentation algorithm which uses a graph-theoretical approach, namely the
notion of dominant sets to cluster images.

DoSer is based on the work of Massimiliano Pavan and Marcello Pelillo, titled
_Efficiently Segmenting Images with Dominant Sets_. See the full paper at
[Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30125-7_3).
